This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/tables/etc.<br/>I also encourage you to look at the code that created this post to learn some more advanced tips about using markdown in Beautiful Jekyll.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

You can use MathJax to write LaTeX expressions. For example:
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

How about a yummy crepe?

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages. You can read more about it in the FAQ. To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions in the FAQ. Here is proof that it can be fixed:
